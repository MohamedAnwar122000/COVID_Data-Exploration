-- Total Cases vs Total Deaths
-- Shows likelihood of dying if you contract covid in your country

Select Location, date, total_cases,total_deaths, (total_deaths/total_cases)*100 as DeathPercentage

-- Total Cases vs Population
-- Shows what percentage of population infected with Covid

Select Location, date, Population, total_cases,  (total_cases/population)*100 as PercentPopulationInfected
From CovidProject..CovidDeaths
order by 5 desc


-- Countries with Highest Infection Rate compared to Population

Select Location, Population, MAX(total_cases) as HighestInfectionCount,  Max((total_cases/population))*100 as PercentPopulationInfected
From CovidProject..CovidDeaths
Group by Location , population
order by PercentPopulationInfected desc


-- Countries with Highest Death Count per Population
-- The Total_deaths column is stored as nvarchar, so we need to use CAST to convert it to int.
-- This conversion allows us to perform numerical operations (like MAX) on the data,
-- as functions like MAX require numeric types and cannot operate on text (nvarchar) data.
